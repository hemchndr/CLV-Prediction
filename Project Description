**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to predict customer lifetime value (CLV) and segment customers based on their CLV. This information will be provided to the marketing team to optimize campaigns and customer acquisition costs (CPA).

**Introduction:**

This project uses a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing transactional data from a UK-based e-commerce store specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. Key features of the dataset include Invoice Number, Stock Code, Product Description, Product Quantity, Invoice Date, Unit Price, and Customer ID.

Understanding Customer Lifetime Value:

**Abstract:**

Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a crucial metric in customer experience programs. It measures the total value a customer brings to a business over the entire period of their relationship, beyond just the first purchase. CLV helps businesses determine a reasonable cost per acquisition and highlights the importance of retaining existing customers, which is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

**Challenges:**

Some companies struggle to measure CLV due to segregated teams, inadequate systems, and untargeted marketing efforts.

**Importance of Tracking CLV:**

CLV informs marketers about the revenue they can expect from a customer throughout their business relationship. The longer a customer continues to purchase from a company, the higher their lifetime value.

Model Selection and Business Context:

There are various methods to calculate CLV, but the choice of method depends on understanding the business context and its customers.

**Types of Business Context:**

Contractual: In contractual businesses, there is a definite time when customers will churn (e.g., subscription services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime).

Non-Contractual: In non-contractual businesses, customers may leave silently without any notification (e.g., retail/e-commerce). This makes CLV calculation more challenging.

**Purchase Opportunities Types:**

Continuous: Customers make continuous purchases.
Discrete: Purchases occur at specific intervals (e.g., subscription plans).
Based on these contexts, the appropriate method for calculating CLV can be chosen.

**Purpose of the Research:**

The study aims to investigate methods suitable for non-contractual, continuous business contexts to estimate potential revenue (CLV) generated by active customers. The Beta Geo-Negative Binomial Distribution (BG-NBD) and Gamma-Gamma Distribution models were applied to this case study. Additionally, customers were segmented based on their RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores, and marketing recommendations were provided.
